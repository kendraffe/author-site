The JWA's Emily Cataneo and I dug into the potential of YA literature to smash the patriarchy! Also discussed: the power of minority representation, tips for young feminists, and the ways we teach girls their bodies are flawed and all the ways that's damaging. [Read the interview here]({{page.link}}), and check out Emily's beautiful, dark and dreamy stories [here][emily].
