Clarion was a whirlwind and has opened my mind in one million directions. I've always haunted best the strange middle spaces between magic and reality, and after six weeks of intensive speculative fiction reading and writing with some of the world's greatest minds, I'm delighted to start sending weirder pieces out into the world. This spring, look for new original fiction in Lightspeed and Apex, and a reprint of "Asymmetry" in PodCastle.
