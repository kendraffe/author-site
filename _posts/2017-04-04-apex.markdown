Dear friends! My first hard SFF story, "The Selkie Wives" was published in [Apex Magazine]({{page.link}}) this week. It is about mystical seal-women and how the patriarchy is terrible. Cue realization that 90% of my stories follow the formula "about _________ and how the patriarchy is terrible"; cue realization that I am living the dream. [Happy reading!]({{page.link}})
