Published by One Story in the summer of 2015, this Pushcart Prize-winning story explores the life and mind of a Vietnam veteran whose PTSD and complex relationship with language mire him in a world of uncertain fictions. The piece will be reprinted in the 2016 Best American Nonrequired Reading, at which point the author will spontaneously combust from happiness.
