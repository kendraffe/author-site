In the summer of 2015, I created a school library at Skybridge Academy, a private school in Austin. With some donated shelves, an ambitious spreadsheet and a $500 budget, I undertook collection development, thrify acquisition, and processing for an up-to-date, relevant library for students grades 6-12.

Interested in learning more about the project, or undertaking something similar yourself? [Check out the project here.]({{ page.link }})
