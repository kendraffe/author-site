At the end of her week with us at the Clarion workshop in 2016, [certified genius][macarthur] Kelly Link challenged us to come up with professional goals lists. I call mine the Vanity List. It lives in a folder on my desktop, and I've quietly checked things off ([publish an audiobook][audiobook], [appear on the legendary BookPeople marquee][marquee], [appear in the New York Times in a vintage ballgown][nyt], etc). This month, I'm over the moon to achieve one more fierce dream: appear as an author at Austin's magnificent Texas Book Festival. Come hear me and brilliant YA authors Carrie Fountain ([I'M NOT MISSING][carriefountain]) and Maurene Goo ([THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL][maurenegoo]) discuss Not Your Everyday Teen Problems in the **YA HQ tent** on **Sunday, Oct. 28 at 2 p.m.** Come on over. Let's chat.

As always, Hole in the Middle order info, plus reviews and more, is [here][sohohitm]. And if you've had the chance to read the book, please show it some love on [Goodreads][holegoodreads]! Thanks, lovelies. I appreciate you.
