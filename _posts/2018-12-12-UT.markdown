Career news! I'm overjoyed to return to UT Austin this spring as its Visiting Fiction Writer. It's an enormous honor, and I can't wait to get back in the classroom ([and continue aggressively tell young writers to love themselves and their work][skybrary]). Here's to a spring semester of growth and creativity.
