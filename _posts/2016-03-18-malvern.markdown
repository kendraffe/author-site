I had the opportunity to read in the I Scream Social series at the wonderful, independent shop Malvern Books in Austin, Texas during South by Southwest. It was ominously stormy and gorgeous, and there was free ice cream, and the hosts shot [this video][video] of me reading a fabulist flash fiction about breasts and ["Leonardo or Lenin or Princess Diana,"][story] a short story about dead pets, social anxiety, and the strange, small homes of miracles.
