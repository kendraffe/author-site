...that I ever dreamed it could be, and more. Enormous thank you to everyone who came out to LeVar Burton Reads Live! at the Paramount on Sunday -- it was beyond inspiring to share the stage as the guest of legendary LeVar Burton, and to meet so many fans of his work. [Click for more.][more]

I've been getting messages all day from writers and readers and people working on their own heartbreak. I am humbled to hear from you all. Thank you for receiving me so kindly and trusting me with your stories. Austin, you're beautiful -- and (ahem) you don't have to take MY word for it.

If you'd like to read more of my work, you're in the right place! Just click on the [stories][stories] tab in the top nav to browse. For more fantasy-weird, I'd recommend ["Continue? Y/N,"][npc] about a sentient video game NPC, or ["Mermaids at the End of the Universe,"][mermaid] which is exactly what it sounds like. For more on heartbreak or grief, look for ["The Third Stage"][stage], or the prequel to "Asymmetry," which is called "X Approaching One."

Or look for my weird novel, ["Hole in the Middle"][book], which is available everywhere books are sold (or loaned! -- in Reading Rainbow spirit, you can look for or request a copy at your local library).

Please listen for our episode of LeVar Burton Reads in the coming months, and stay in touch! xx, k
