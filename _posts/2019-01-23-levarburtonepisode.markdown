2018 was truly wild: between the publication of my [debut novel][amazon], getting married during a [freak polar shift][wedding], returning to UT Austin to teach fiction writing, and curtseying in a vintage ballgown at One Story's Literary Debutante Ball, I got to hear legendary LeVar Burton read a break-up story of mine aloud to a packed house at Austin's historic Paramount Theatre. You can listen to the episode -- including a follow-up interview with me and LeVar -- for free [here][episode]. (2019, you've got a lot to live up to.)
