Sometimes your publisher asks you to do an interview, [and you end up talking about how your novel began as a voice in your head that wouldn't shut up][sohointerview] and also [shouting in all caps about how therapy is genuinely lovely][sohointerview], and your publisher is nice enough to share it on their website without gently suggesting that these two things might be correlated.

(Seriously, though, kids: go see the feelings doctor.) (Would you try to fill your own cavities? No? Well then.)
