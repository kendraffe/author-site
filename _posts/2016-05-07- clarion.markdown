I'm immensely excited to share that I've been invited to attend the Clarion Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers' Workshop in San Diego, where I'll learn about the art of genre-writing from masters of the form Kelly Link, Ted Chiang, Andy Duncan, Victor LaValle, Delia Sherman and Ellen Kushner.

This year's class of 18 students is a diverse group in interest, age and experience, descending upon the UC San Diego campus from all over the world for six weeks of intensive writing, reading and workshopping. If you'd like to know more about us, or about the program, [take a peek at the Clarion 2016 blog here.]({{ page.link }})
