In advance of the publication of my [debut novel][amazon], I talked with [FLAPPERHOUSE's]({{page.link}}) Maria Pinto about discovering characters, wanting to back-up dance for Of Montreal, and how writing a novel is like trying to carry an armload of spaghetti up the stairs. [Read the interview here,]({{page.link}}) and [preorder the novel here][amazon].
