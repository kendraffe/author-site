Sometimes a nice blog asks you to write 200 words about whether your book passes the page 69 test, and you submit an introvert manifesto about how extroversion is more insidious than patriarchy, and they publish it anyway. A thousand blessings upon the head of [The Page 69 Test, here][69].

Hole in the Middle order info, plus reviews and more [here][sohohitm]. And if you've had the chance to read the book, please show it some love on [Goodreads][holegoodreads]! Thanks, lovelies. I appreciate you.
