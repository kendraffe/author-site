I have a wee magical realist chapbook and it is now in the world. "The Girl Who Could Only Say 'sex, drugs, and rock & roll'" is a queer, magical love story about the hazy dreamworld of adolescence and the ways language reveals--and constrains--us. Palm-sized and beautifully handbound by independent Austin-based publisher Awst Press.
