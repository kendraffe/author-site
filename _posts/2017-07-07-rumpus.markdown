On the eve of my [book release][amazon], Lyz Lenz at The Rumpus was kind enough to let firecracker teen librarian [Gretchen Alice][gretchen] and me put together a reading list of books for/by young women who are using their voices to fight back in a pussy-grabbing world. Girls, your voice matters -- now speak (and read!) out. [Check out the list here.]({{page.link}})
