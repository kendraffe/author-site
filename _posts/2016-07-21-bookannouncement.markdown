Wondrous news: my debut novel has a cover, and I love it. It feels free-wheeling, as contemporary and strange and indie and somehow collapsing-in-on-itself as the novel and its protagonist. These are the things, dear ones, that keep us up at night: a deep and thrilling joy.

See the full cover and (kindly) add it to your to-read list on [Goodreads]({{ page.link }}).

Preorder information forthcoming!
