An interview and story hour with the deeply talented Matthew Anderson, who reads ["The Week of Small Apocalypses,"][wyvern] ["Three and Half Billion Chances,"][peopleh] and ["Things We Believed When We Were Small,"][cheap] and graciously lets me ramble about writing, magical realism, and the regional rivalry between North and South Carolina.
