Kendra Fortmeyer has an MFA from the New Writer's Project at UT Austin and edits fiction for [Broad! Magazine](http://broadzine.com/about/meet-the-staff/). Her work has been nominated for
the Pushcart Prize and Best American Nonrequired Reading and has appeared or is forthcoming in [too many gorgeous places](http://kendrafortmeyer.com/#1).
She wrote a YA magical
realist novel about girls and their bodies that's found brilliant
representation at [The Bent Agency](http://www.thebentagency.com/) and that is looking for, as we say, a forever home. She is currently at work on a new novel.

In addition to writing, Kendra juggles full-time studies in UT's graduate
school for information and library sciences, energetically interns in the
Austin Public Library's Connected Youth program, and teaches creative
writing to the world's craziest, most brilliant teenagers at [Skybridge
Academy](http://www.skybridgeatx.com/staff/) in Austin, Texas.
She also [founded a library there](https://theamazingskybrary.wordpress.com/).

(She thought a long time about whether this page should be in the first
 or third person. To the dismay of multitudes, she chose this.)
