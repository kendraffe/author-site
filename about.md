Kendra Fortmeyer has an MFA from the New Writer's Project at UT Austin and edits fiction for [Broad! Magazine](http://broadzine.com/about/meet-the-staff/). Her writing has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best American Nonrequired Reading and has appeared or is forthcoming in [too many gorgeous places](http://kendrafortmeyer.com/#1).
She wrote a YA magical realist novel about girls and their bodies that's found brilliant representation at [The Bent Agency](http://www.thebentagency.com/), and is currently at work on a new novel.

In addition to writing, Kendra juggles full-time studies in UT's graduate school for information and library sciences, energetically interns in the Austin Public Library's Connected Youth program, and is a blissfully happy student librarian in Austin's Independent School District. She is the former English teacher at Skybridge Academy, an Austin private school where she also [founded a library](https://theamazingskybrary.wordpress.com/).

(She thought a long time about whether this page should be in the first or third person. To the dismay of multitudes, she chose this.)
