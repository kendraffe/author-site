In the words of <a href="https://www.reverbnation.com/kurtfortmeyer">her father<a/>, Kendra Fortmeyer was “born in a barn and raised in a stable environment.” She grew up in the lush woods of central North Carolina, surrounded by stacks of books from her local small-town library. Now a Pushcart Prize-winning fiction writer and dedicated youth librarian, her work has been recognized by grants from the Elizabeth George Foundation, the Dafna Zamarripa-Gensundheit Prize, and the Michener Center for Writers, and has appeared in One Story, The Toast, Black Warrior Review and [elsewhere]({{ page.link }}). She received her MFA in fiction from the New Writers Project at UT Austin, and her MLIS from the School of Information, and will attend the Clarion Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers workshop in the summer of 2016.
