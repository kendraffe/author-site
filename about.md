In the words of <a href="https://www.reverbnation.com/kurtfortmeyer">her father<a/>, Kendra Fortmeyer was "born in a barn and raised in a stable environment." She grew up in the lush woods of central North Carolina, surrounded by stacks of books from her local small-town library. Now a Pushcart Prize-winning fiction writer, Kendra has been recognized by grants from the Elizabeth George Foundation, the Dafna Zamarripa-Gensundheit Prize, and the Michener Center for Writers, and her writing has appeared in *The Best American Nonrequired Reading*, *One Story*, *Lightspeed*, The Toast, and [elsewhere]({{ page.link }}). She received her MFA in fiction from the New Writers Project at UT Austin, and is a 2016 graduate of the Clarion Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers' Workshop. Her debut magical realist novel for young adults, THE HOLE IN THE MIDDLE, is available now.
