Her work has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best American Nonrequired Reading and has appeared or is forthcoming in <a href ="http://kendrafortmeyer.com/#1">too many gorgeous places</a>. She wrote a YA magical realist novel about girls and their bodies that's found brilliant representation at <a href="http://www.thebentagency.com/">The Bent Agency</a> and that is looking for, as we say, a forever home. She is currently at work on a new novel.
