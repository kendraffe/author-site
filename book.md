How do you know who you are when part of you is missing?

Morgan Stone was born with a hole in her middle: perfectly smooth patch of nothing where a something should be. After seventeen years of fear and shame, doctors and nurses, "peculiar" not "perfect," she has had enough of hiding. 

Feisty, feminist and downright different, Hole in the Middle is the story of what happens when a girl who is anything but normal confronts a world obsessed with body image and celebrity.

**Reviews and praise**

"Intriguing and innovative.... With this debut, Fortmeyer establishes herself as a writer to watch." -- *[The Irish Times]({{page.IrishTimes_link}})*

"Dazzling, one hundred percent believable, and laugh-out-loud funny. Kendra Fortmeyer has an admirably weird brain." -- Kelly Link, author of *Get in Trouble*

"Kendra Fortmeyer's debut is more heart than holes, creatively brilliant, wacky and wise. An author to watch!" -- Bonnie-Sue Hitchcock, author of the Carnegie Medal-shortlisted *The Smell of Other People's Houses*

"HOLE IN THE MIDDLE is poetic and peculiar: a story about discovering yourself in all your strange excesses and missing parts and learning how to show them to the world." -- Heidi Heilig, author of *The Girl From Everywhere*
